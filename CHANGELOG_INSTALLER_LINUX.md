**Note:** If you cannot start/stop adapters using the command line, you have to edit the iobroker binary:
  ```
  sudo nano $(which iob)
  ```
  and change
  ```
  if [ "$1" = "start" ] || [ "$1" = "stop" ] || [ "$1" = "restart" ]; then
  ```
  to
  ```
  if (( $# == 1 )) && ([ "$1" = "start" ] || [ "$1" = "stop" ] || [ "$1" = "restart" ]); then
  ```
  Then exit and save.

* Creation of the executables iob and iobroker
* Automated installation of commonly used packages
* More logs into INSTALLER_INFO.txt
* Automatic IP address detection for the final message
* Detection if the installer script is being run as a result of npm install or some other command. _This should fix failures during execution of npm rebuild._
* Run all iobroker commands as the iobroker user if possible
* Fix iobroker start/stop/restart/status when systemd is used

**Note:** Since so much is now being done in the installer script, manual installations on Linux/OSX/FreeBSD using `npm` are forbidden since `v2.0.0`, which was released on 2019-01-21.


## 2019-01-02 (and earlier)
* this version introducted writing INSTALLER_INFO.txt into the ioBroker directory with installation details used later on for support reasons
